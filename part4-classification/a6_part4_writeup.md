# Part 4 - Classification Writeup

After completing `a6_part4.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Comment out the StandardScaler and re-run your test. How accurate is the model? Why is that?
The Accuracy before is 0.82 and the accuracy after is 0.67 meaning without scaler the data is less accurate, because the scaler can make the date more understanble to the computer to learn. (I think)

2. How accurate is the model with the StandardScaler? Is this model accurate enough for the given use case? Explain.
I think that yes it is accurate enough because the accuracy is at 0.82 whihc is only .18 from 1 whihc would mean that the data is completely accurate.

3. Looking at the predicted and actual results, how did the model do? Was there a pattern to the inputs that the model was incorrect about?
The model was pretty accurate with a few moments where is would predict Iris-setose and the actualy species Iris-virginica.

4. Would a 34 year old Female who makes 56000 a year buy an SUV according to the model? Remember to scale the data before running it through the model.
No it would not make sense for the lady to buy an SUV model.
