# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The r squared is 0.84 and this means that the dependent data is more accurate and has a better fit to data. 

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Not completely becuase the r squared is not 1 but the model is kind of accurate. 

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
The 10 -year-old car with 89000 miles is worth 8703.25 and the other car is worth 714.10.

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
Since the graph is a linear model to line will eventually reach the negatives as it does with the postive.
