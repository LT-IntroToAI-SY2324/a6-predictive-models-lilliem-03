# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value tells you how important the independent variable is by explaining its relation to the dependent variable.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
147

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think the model may predict an accurate range but not the exact valua to be reliable enough ot predict someones blood pressure based on their age. I think this is because not everyone is aligns with liner data and so you would have to include other variables.
