After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value tells how te independant variables explains the dependant variable 
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
140
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think this models predictions are accurate but not accurate anough to reliably predict someones blood pressure based on thier age, I think it is better at giving you a range than an exact value.
