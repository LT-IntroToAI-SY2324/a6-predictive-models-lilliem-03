# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
I would give the red group or group in the top left hand corner the shopaholic name becuase they have a really high spending score but a low annual income, I would call the purple group or group in the bottom right corner would be frugal people as they have a high annual income but low spending score meaning that they have hte funds to be high spenders but don't. I think the bottom left, middle, and top right would all be considered reasonable as they all spend around the amount of their income.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
They would be in the bottom right or orange group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
I think for the top left group they would just have to appeal to the group as something that they think they need, essentially create a problem or hype over something and advertize to the people, they will most likely buy it if they feel like they need it.
