# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model used more data than the last so it had more to learn from and find a pattern.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells us that the model is more accurate as the R squared value is 0.73 so it is closer to one and more accurate.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
No, I think the model is more accurate than before but not completely accurate, as people are different and have different conditions for different reasons. Blood Presure is affected by a lot of things not just age so you can't just generalize data for everyone in that sense.
